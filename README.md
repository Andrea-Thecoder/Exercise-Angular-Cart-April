This exercise was done on my initiative during the basic Angular course in April (Labfortraining). 
The idea is to simulate an e-commerce website with a worked shopping cart and product search. 
My focus was on the functionality, so TypeScript.

I used this exercise to lay the groundwork for creating my shopping cart for the second exam project, which we had to submit on May 21st (see repository: https://github.com/Andrea-Thecoder/AngularFakeE-commerce). 
This version of the cart is very basic, and the version I ended up using in the exam project is a much improved and more realistic version of this.

Like all my exercises, there's a touch of irony!"

P.s. remember to start json-server to view the product on webpage.
